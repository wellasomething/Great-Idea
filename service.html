                    <p>Creating an iOS app involves many steps; exactly which steps an iOS Developer works on will depend largely on their level of seniority, the size of their company, and the scope of the app itself. A Senior iOS Developer, for example, is much more likely to be involved in the initial research and conceptualization phases, while a Junior iOS Developer working in a large firm might have a list of responsibilities limited to just one or two phases, or contribute to a single feature within a single phase.</p>

                <div class ="prod"> <h3> ANDROID DEVELOPMENT </h3>
                    <p>Obviously, the first step in creating an app is to think of an idea. What’s your app going to do, and how? Closely tied to this is competitive market research—looking into how much demand there is for your idea and what competition you might face. Once you’re satisfied that you’ve come up with an original idea for an app that people will want to use, it still remains to ensure that it will conform to Apple’s terms of service, which stipulate an app’s requirements for user privacy and security, design, copyright, decency, and so on. </p>
